## Praytic Privacy Statement

Effective date: January 1, 2025

Welcome to the Praytic Privacy Statement. This is where we describe how we handle your "Personal Data", which is information that is directly linked or can be linked to you. It applies to the Personal Data that Praytic LLC processes as the "Data Controller" when you interact with websites, applications, and services that display this Statement (collectively, "Services").

### Third Party Access and Data Protection

When you use third-party extensions, integrations, or follow references and links within our Services, the privacy policies of these third parties apply to any Personal Data you provide or consent to share with them. Their privacy statements will govern how this data is processed.

## Personal Data We Collect

Personal Data is collected from you directly, automatically from your device, and also from third parties. The Personal Data Praytic processes when you use the Services depends on variables like how you interact with our Services (such as through web interfaces, desktop or mobile applications) and the features you use. Below, we detail the information we collect through each of these channels:

Please review the privacy statements of these companies for more information.
* Essential Cookies and Similar Tracking Technologies: We use cookies and similar technologies to provide essential functionality like storing settings and recognizing you while using our Services.
* Non-essential Cookies: Depending on your jurisdiction, we may use online analytics products that use cookies to help us analyze how de-identified users use our Services and to enhance your experience when you use the Services. We may also employ third-party Cookies to gather data for interest-based advertising. In some jurisdictions, we only use non-essential cookies after obtaining your consent. See [this](#what-are-your-cookie-choices-and-controls) section for more details and control options.

## Lawful Bases for Processing Personal Data (Applicable to EEA and UK End Users)

We aim to promptly respond to requests in compliance with legal requirements. Please note that we may retain certain data as necessary for legal obligations or for establishing, exercising, or defending legal claims.

## International data transfers

Praytic stores and processes Personal Data in a variety of locations, including your local region, the United States, and other countries where Praytic, its affiliates, subsidiaries, or subprocessors have operations. We transfer Personal Data from the European Union, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland to countries that the European Commission has not recognized as having an adequate level of data protection. When we engage in such transfers, we generally rely on the standard contractual clauses published by the European Commission under [Commission Implementing Decision 2021/914](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dec_impl/2021/914/oj), to help protect your rights and enable these protections to travel with your data. To learn more about the European Commission's decisions on the adequacy of the protection of personal data in the countries where Praytic processes personal data, see this article on the [European Commission website](https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions_en).

## Security and Retention

Praytic uses appropriate administrative, technical, and physical security controls to protect your Personal Data. We'll retain your Personal Data as long as your account is active and as needed to fulfill contractual obligations, comply with legal requirements, resolve disputes, and enforce agreements. The retention duration depends on the purpose of data collection and any legal obligations.

## Security

Praytic uses administrative, technical, and physical security controls where appropriate to protect your Personal Data.

## Contact Us

## Information for Minors

Our Services are not intended for individuals under the age of 13. We do not intentionally gather Personal Data from such individuals. If you become aware that a minor has provided us with Personal Data, please notify us at praytic.global@gmail.com.

## Changes to Our Privacy Statement

Praytic may periodically revise this Privacy Statement. If there are material changes to the statement, we will provide at least 30 days prior notice by updating our website or sending an email to your primary email address associated with your Praytic account.

## Our use of cookies and tracking technologies

### Cookies and tracking technologies

Praytic uses cookies to provide, secure and improve our Service or to develop new features and functionality of our Service. For example, we use them to (i) keep you logged in, (ii) remember your preferences, (iii) identify your device for security and fraud purposes, including as needed to maintain the integrity of our Service, (iv) compile statistical reports, and (v) provide information and insight for future development of Praytic.

Our emails to users may contain a pixel tag, which is a small, clear image that can tell us whether or not you have opened an email and what your IP address is. We use this pixel tag to make our email communications more effective and to make sure we are not sending you unwanted email.

The length of time a cookie will stay on your browser or device depends on whether it is a "persistent" or "session" cookie. Session cookies will only stay on your device until you stop browsing. Persistent cookies stay until they expire or are deleted. The expiration time or retention period applicable to persistent cookies depends on the purpose of the cookie collection and tool used. You may be able to delete cookie data.

#### What are cookies and similar technologies?

We use cookies and similar technologies, such as web beacons, local storage, and mobile analytics, to operate and provide our Services.

Cookies are small text files stored by your browser on your device. A cookie can later be read when your browser connects to a web server in the same domain that placed the cookie. The text in a cookie contains a string of numbers and letters that may uniquely identify your device and can contain other information as well. This allows the web server to recognize your browser over time, each time it connects to that web server.

Web beacons are electronic images (also called "single-pixel" or "clear GIFs") that are contained within a website or email. When your browser opens a webpage or email that contains a web beacon, it automatically connects to the web server that hosts the image (typically operated by a third party). This allows that web server to log information about your device and to set and read its own cookies. In the same way, third-party content on our websites (such as embedded videos, plug-ins, or ads) results in your browser connecting to the third-party web server that hosts that content.

Mobile identifiers for analytics can be accessed and used by apps on mobile devices in much the same way that websites access and use cookies.

We may also use so-called "flash cookies" (also known as "Local Shared Objects" or "LSOs") to collect and store information about your use of our Services. Flash cookies are commonly used for advertisements and videos.

#### How do we and our partners use cookies and similar technologies?

The Praytic Services use cookies and similar technologies for a variety of purposes, including to store your preferences and settings, enable you to sign-in, analyze how our Services perform, track your interaction with the Services, develop inferences, combat fraud, and fulfill other legitimate purposes. Some of these cookies and technologies may be provided by third parties, including service providers and advertising partners. For example, our analytics and advertising partners may use these technologies in our Services to collect personal information (such as the pages you visit, the links you click on, and similar usage information, identifiers, and device information) related to your online activities over time and across Services for various purposes, including targeted advertising.

We and/or our partners also share the information we collect or infer with third parties for these purposes.

The table below provides additional information about how we use different types of cookies:

| Purpose | Description |
|:---|:---|
| Required Cookies | Praytic uses required cookies to perform essential website functions and to provide the services. For example, cookies are used to log you in, save your language preferences, improve performance, route traffic between web servers, detect the size of your screen, determine page load times, improve user experience, and for audience measurement. These cookies are necessary for our websites to work. |
| Analytics | We allow third parties to use analytics cookies to understand how you use our websites so we can make them better. For example, cookies are used to gather information about the pages you visit and how many clicks you need to accomplish a task. We also use some analytics cookies to provide personalized advertising. |
| Social Media | Praytic and third parties use social media cookies to show you ads and content based on your social media profiles and activity on Praytic's websites. This ensures that the ads and content you see on our websites and on social media will better reflect your interests. This also enables third parties to develop and improve their products, which they may use on websites that are not owned or operated by Praytic. |
| Advertising | In addition, Praytic and third parties use advertising cookies to show you new ads based on ads you've already seen. Cookies also track which ads you click or purchases you make after clicking an ad. This is done both for payment purposes and to show you ads that are more relevant to you. For example, cookies are used to detect when you click an ad and to show you ads based on your social media interests and website browsing history. |

#### What are your cookie choices and controls?

You have several options to disable non-essential cookies:

1. **On Praytic Websites**

   Any Praytic page that serves non-essential cookies will have a link in the page's footer to cookie settings. You can express your preferences at any time by clicking on that linking and updating your settings.

   Some users will also be able to manage non-essential cookies via a cookie consent banner, including the options to accept, manage, and reject all non-essential cookies.

2. **Generally for all websites**

   You can control the cookies you encounter on the web using a variety of widely-available tools. For example:

* If your browser sends a [Do Not Track](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Not_Track) (DNT) signal, Praytic will not set non-essential cookies and will not load third party resources which set non-essential cookies.
* Many browsers provide cookie controls which may limit the types of cookies you encounter online. Check out the documentation for your browser to learn more.
* If you enable a browser extension designed to block tracking, such as [Privacy Badger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_Badger), non-essential cookies set by a website or third parties may be disabled.
* If you enable a browser extension designed to block unwanted content, such as [uBlock Origin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UBlock_Origin), non-essential cookies will be disabled to the extent that content that sets non-essential cookies will be blocked.
* You may use the Global Privacy Control (GPC) to communicate your privacy preferences. If Praytic detects the GPC signal from your device, Praytic will not share your data (we do not sell your data). To learn more, visit [Global Privacy Control — Take Control Of Your Privacy](https://globalprivacycontrol.org/)
* Advertising controls. Our advertising partners may participate in associations that provide simple ways to opt out of ad targeting, which you can access at:
  * United States: [NAI](http://optout.networkadvertising.org) and [DAA](http://optout.aboutads.info/)
  * Canada: [Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada](https://youradchoices.ca/)
  * Europe: [European Digital Advertising Alliance](http://www.youronlinechoices.com/)

These choices are specific to the browser you are using. If you access our Services from other devices or browsers, take these actions from those systems to ensure your choices apply to the data collected when you use those systems.
