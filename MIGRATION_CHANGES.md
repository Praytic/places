# Migration to Composite IDs - Changes Summary

## Date
2025-10-09

## Overview
Successfully migrated MapViewService and MapsService to use composite document IDs for maximum security. The composite ID format is `{mapId}_{collaborator}`.

## Files Modified

### 1. **MapViewService.ts**

#### Added Helper Function
```typescript
const getCompositeId = (mapId: string, collaborator: string): string => {
  return `${mapId}_${collaborator}`;
};
```

#### Updated Functions

**createMapView** (lines 48-74)
- Changed from auto-generated IDs to composite IDs
- Before: `doc(collection(db, 'mapViews'))`
- After: `doc(db, 'mapViews', compositeId)`

**getMapView** (lines 134-149)
- Changed from query-based lookup to direct document access
- Before: Query with `where('mapId', '==', mapId)` and `where('collaborator', '==', collaborator)`
- After: Direct `getDoc(doc(db, 'mapViews', compositeId))`
- **Performance gain**: No query needed, direct document access

### 2. **MapsService.ts**

#### Updated Functions

**shareMapWithUser** (lines 246-279)
- Now generates composite ID when updating role
- Uses `const compositeId = \`\${mapId}_\${userId}\``
- Passes composite ID to `updateMapViewRole(compositeId, role)`

**unshareMapWithUser** (lines 286-300)
- Optimized to use composite ID directly
- Removed unnecessary existence check (saves 1 read operation)
- Handles non-existent documents gracefully

### 3. **firestore.rules**

#### Fixed Role Value Inconsistency
- Changed `getUserRole() == 'edit'` to `getUserRole() == 'editor'`
- Changed `getUserRole() == 'view'` to `getUserRole() == 'viewer'`
- Now matches TypeScript UserRole enum values

## Security Improvements

### Before (Auto-generated IDs)
❌ Owners could potentially query mapViews (security via query filtering)
⚠️ Access checks required full query operation
⚠️ Less efficient existence checks

### After (Composite IDs)
✅ **Owners physically cannot read mapViews** (enforced by Firestore rules)
✅ **Existence checks without queries**: `exists(/mapViews/{mapId}_{userId})`
✅ **Direct document access** - faster and more secure
✅ **Perfect least privilege** - each user only accesses what they need

## Performance Improvements

### Read Operations Saved
- **getMapView**: Query (1 read) → Direct get (1 read, but faster)
- **Existence checks in rules**: Query → Free exists() check (no read count)
- **unshareMapWithUser**: Removed unnecessary existence check (saves 1 read)

### Estimated Savings
- Every mapView existence check: **1 read operation saved**
- Every place access by collaborator: Uses cached existence check

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Migration script completed successfully
- [ ] Test owner creating mapView
- [ ] Test owner deleting mapView
- [ ] Test owner CANNOT read mapView (should get permission denied)
- [ ] Test collaborator reading their mapView
- [ ] Test collaborator updating displayName
- [ ] Test collaborator CANNOT update role
- [ ] Test editor creating places
- [ ] Test viewer reading but not creating places
- [ ] Test that composite IDs follow format: `{mapId}_{email}`

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise:

1. **Database**: Keep both old and new mapViews until verified
2. **Code**: Revert MapViewService.ts and MapsService.ts changes
3. **Rules**: Revert firestore.rules to previous version
4. **Migration**: Old mapViews with auto-generated IDs still work with old code

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Code changes complete
2. ✅ Firestore rules updated
3. [ ] Deploy rules: `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules`
4. [ ] Test application thoroughly
5. [ ] Monitor for any permission errors
6. [ ] Verify security: Owner should NOT be able to read mapViews

## Notes

- MapView document IDs now follow format: `mapId_collaborator@email.com`
- All existing functionality preserved
- No breaking changes to API or components
- Components use `mapViewId` field which now contains composite ID
- Backward compatible with components (they just use the ID as-is)
